############# EXPERIENCE IN DIFFERNE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #############
########################################################################

Here I present a short description of my skills and experience in different programming languages.
I have created a file for each individual programming language. In these are short description of what I have used the language for, the books/blogs I have read in order to improve my skills in the language, the packages/modules I have used in connection with this, and some examples of code I have written. The idea of the examples is to show some of my skills and experience in the given lanague. Though, "some" as I want it to be something that gives a good idea of my skills and experience, but still fairly quick to read.

In order to improve my knowledge about algorithms, I am currently reading "Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ron Rivest, Clifford Stein
